        "answer": "Authentication (Supabase), payment processing (Stripe/LemonSqueezy), enterprise security (Arcjet), database (PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM), email integration (Mailgun), modern UI (shadcn/ui), and much more. Check the Features section for the complete list."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need coding experience?",
        "answer": "You should be comfortable with React and Next.js. NextShip is a starter template, not a no-code solution. It saves you setup time but assumes you know how to build features."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the service costs?",
        "answer": "Most services have generous free tiers: Supabase (free tier available), Stripe (pay per transaction), Arcjet (free tier), Vercel (free for personal projects). You can start with $0/month and scale as you grow."

      },
      {
        "question": "How do I get updates?",
        "answer": "NextShip is a starter template, so you clone it once and own your copy. You can pull updates from the repo if you want, but your project becomes independent after cloning."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it production ready?",
        "answer": "Yes! NextShip includes enterprise-grade security, error handling, and best practices. Many developers have launched products with it. However, you should still test thoroughly and review the code for your specific needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "What payment providers are supported?",
        "answer": "Both Stripe and LemonSqueezy are pre-configured. Stripe is better for US-based businesses with complex needs. LemonSqueezy is easier to set up and handles global taxes automatically."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you offer support?",
        "answer": "Community support is available via GitHub discussions. Priority support with direct access to the creator is available as a paid add-on."
